# LEGO Mindstorms Project - SARKIAP-1 Transformer

This project, developed as part of the **Digital Logic Design (EE-221)** course at **National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Balochistan Campus**, presents the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor kit, specifically our creation: **SARKIAP-1 the Transformer**. 

## Project Overview

**SARKIAP-1** is a remote-controlled transformer robot that shifts between car and biped modes, showcasing capabilities in robotics, mechanics, and programming through LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor (51515).

### Key Features

- **Transformation**: Transitions from car mode to a humanoid robot mode that can walk.
- **Robust Design**: Built with modular assemblies for legs, torso, shoulders, and more, allowing dynamic transformations.
- **Advanced Programming**: Controlled using the LEGO Mindstorms coding app, supporting both Scratch-based visual coding and Python.

## Project Components

### Hardware
- **Smart Hub**: Central processing with Bluetooth, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sensors.
- **Motors**: Three motors control foot movement and torso transformation.
- **Sensors**: Color and distance sensors enhance interactive capabilities.

### Software
- **LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor App**: Used for building, coding, and controlling SARKIAP-1, with more than 50 activities and visual coding support for beginners and Python for advanced users.

## Assembly

The project includes multiple subassemblies:
- **Legs and Feet**: Enables movement in humanoid mode.
- **Torso and Shoulders**: Designed for stability in transformations.
- **Front Bumper and Windscreen**: Built for the aesthetic of the car mode and protection.

## Applications

SARKIAP-1 demonstrates a variety of applications:
- **STEM Education**: Perfect for learning robotics and coding fundamentals.
- **Remote Control**: Operable using Bluetooth controllers like PS4 and Xbox.
- **Interactive Play**: Ideal for activities like obstacle courses, defense (missile shooting), and dance routines.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements include:
- Adding voice commands and improved AI functionality.
- Upgrading the design to feature additional modes and actions.
- Implementing new control features like integration with PlayStation controllers.
